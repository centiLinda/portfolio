Hi, my name is Liao Yuwen. I'm a robotics engineer and an undergraduate student from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

This site is a collection of all the engineering projects I've done. 

I listen to rock and J-pop. I play the piano and harmonica. I watch anime and read random books. I love animals and I adopted a cat named Kiwi.

- The idea of having a portfolio site is inspired by [Daniel Miessler](https://danielmiessler.com/).
- This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- I'll keep this site updated.
