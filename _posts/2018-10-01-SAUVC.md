[SAUVC](https://sauvc.org/) is an annual international AUV challenge based in Singapore. `NTU Team MECAtron` joined the competition in 2019 and has since developed 2 models. I worked mainly on the 2nd model and was the Electrical team leader in Year 2 and team captain in Year 3. 

The competition was unfortunately paused for 2 years due to the pandemic. I now serve as a technical consultant for the new team to prepare for SAUVC 2022.

Our robot is designed to perform the following tasks, according to the [SAUVC rulebook](https://sauvc.org/rulebook/):
1. Navigate through a gate without touching a randomly located flare.
2. Drop a ball inside a basket. Each basket is different and containing different marks.
3. Pick up the dropped ball.

The robot also has dimension and weight specifications. The robot need to be fully autonomous, no remote control is allowed.
