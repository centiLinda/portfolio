MA4012 was a Year-4 engineering course on mechatronics systems. Each team was to design `a vehicle that can fetch balls from the arena`.

Each team was given a set of VEX controller and motors. We were limited to only use sensors and switches from the lab while other mechanical structures will be DIYed.

I was the team leader and electrical engineer in charge of fine-tuning of the sensors and designing the sensor configurations. Due to equipment constrains we had to test out several configurations before deciding on the final version. We also added filters in the functions to stabilize the sensor readings.
