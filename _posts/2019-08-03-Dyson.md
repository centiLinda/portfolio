EG9003 was a collaborative course between Dyson and NTU. We were guide through the process of engineering design and each team was to present a product at the end of the course.

Our team’s product was Medicus, an `autonomous pill dispenser for the elderly`. I was the team leader and designer of the dispenser.

Components:
- Arduino UNO
- Servo motor *2
- WiFi module esp8266
- Push button *2
- Limit switch

All programmes are written in Arduino IDE and running on Arduino UNO.

The patient’s data is stored on a free IoT platform Ubidots(link). Data is retrieved and updated via the WiFi module. If the pills are not taken properly, the patient’s relative or care-giver will be notified.

The prototype can store 2 types of pills. At a given time of the day, specific amount of the different pills will be dispensed and the patient will be notified to collect the pills.

We conducted street interviews to help determine the minimum viable product (MVP). The final design was again evaluated by interviewees we found near Singapore General Hospital. The prototype was developed in 2 weeks.
