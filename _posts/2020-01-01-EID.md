EID was a Year-2 design project for all Mechanical Engineering students. Each team was to come up with a design that can solve real-life problems.

Our team’s design was `a retractable wheel that can be attached to common trolleys`. The wheel dimension can be adjusted so it’s easier to pass through obstacles. This makes it easier for elderlies to go for grocery shopping.

Unfortunately, the development was paused due to the pandemic.
