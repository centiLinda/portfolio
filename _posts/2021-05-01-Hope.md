I worked as a `mechanical engineer` in HOPE Technik for my summer internship. HOPE Technik is a robotics and automation company in Singapore. Some of their projects include compact loader for aircraft weapons, temperature assessment system, customized heavy vehicles, exoskeletons, and urban farming system.

I was working with <em>Ellemento Farming</em>, an urban farming project aims to `achieve full automation from seeding to harvesting`. I worked on different sub-systems such as the seeder, transplanter, harvester to fine tune the end effectors and improve the design to achieve higher accuracy.

I manufactured tools and holders for the end effectors using 3D printing, waterjet cutting, and sheet metal bending. One of the pot locking mechanism I designed was implemented on the final prototype.
