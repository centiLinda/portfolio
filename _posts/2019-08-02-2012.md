MA2012 was a Year-2 introductory course to Arduino and hardware electronics. Each group was to design a mechatronics system with the theme "Arena".

Our team's arena was an `interactive maze with a gesture-controlled mini vehicle`. I was the team leader and designer for the mini vehicle.

Components:
- Arduino Nano
- 3.7V LiPo battery
- 3.7V to 5V boost converter
- Motor driver
- Bluetooth module
- Geared DC motor *2
- Breadboard, wheel *2, ball caster

All programmes are written in Arduino IDE and running on Arduino Nano.

The vehicle is controlled by a gesture detection glove. Userâ€™s gesture is detected by the accelerometer on the glove and sent to the car by a paired Bluetooth module. The controller board will then process the command and send respective speed to each motor.
