I worked as a `R&D engineer` in Trinax for my professional internship. Trinax is an interactive media start-up company in Singapore. Some of their projects include virtual events, photo booths, interactive display, and virtual showrooms.

My role was to develop hardware prototypes for their hardware-related projects. I also did research on the latest `interactive technologies` and presented to the market and software teams for future applications. This includes AR, holographic display, kinetic display, and different types of sensors.

This dispenser system will dispense a fragrance card when activated by the user. Fragrance is sprayed immediately before user picks up the card. It consists of off-the-shelf card dispenser, servo motor, IR sensor, Arduino UNO, and Intel NUC for controlling the card dispenser. An enclosure was manufactured and the entire unit was shipped to Japan for evaluation at the end of my internship.
