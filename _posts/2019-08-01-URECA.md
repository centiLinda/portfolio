The project is part of a larger project of developing an `autonomous hospital bed`. Patient’s vital signal is collected in real-time by a wrist band. By modelling the vital signal when nurses are still around and marking it as “normal”, patient’s vital signal during the rest of the trip to surgical room or ward is compared to this normal model. If abnormality is detected, nurses will be called to supervise.

The objective is to reduce the time that nurses need to be around a patient, as most patients are normally in stable conditions. The vital sign analyzed in this experimental study is pulse. However, more parameters need to be taken into consideration in actual applications.

After the 1-year URECA project, I assisted in the development of the autonomous hospital bed prototype. [(Appreciation letter)](http://centiLinda.github.io/portfolio/assets/images/Letter_of_Appreciation.pdf)

I was the 2nd author in the publication of this project on [Sensors](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/17/5711).
