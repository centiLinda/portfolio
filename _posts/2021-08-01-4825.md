MA4825 was a Year-4 engineering course on robot arm design. The team project was to develop a robotic arm and demonstrate its applications. The motors are provided by the lab and the rest of the components are up to us to decide.

Our teamâ€™s idea was to develop `a robotic arm that can play Gomoku (five-in-a-row) against a human`. The biggest challenge was that the motors have limited holding torque while our application requires the arm to be rather long.

I was the team leader and mechanical engineer in charge of the design. Several designs were developed along the way to increase arm stability and accuracy.
